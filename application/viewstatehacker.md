Allows for the decoding/encoding of ASP.NET ViewState. By default ASP.NET ViewState has a hash appended, so therefore re-encoding the data should fail, but this will help when the developers turn that off. And it is a lot easier to view the ViewState contents using this tool, compared to all others. 

## Features ##

- Supports v1.0, v1.1 & v2.0 ASP,NET ViewState decoding
- Easy viewing GUI
