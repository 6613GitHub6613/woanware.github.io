## Info ##

ChromeForensics is an application to extract various bits of activity information from the Google Chrome web browser and the open source version Chromium. All of the core actions e.g. import and export are run on separate threads so there are no graphical user interface (GUI) hangs etc. The user interface displays the Favourite Icons and Thumbnails extracted from the database, which is one area that sets it apart from the other Chrome forensic apps.
