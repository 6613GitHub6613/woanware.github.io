## Info ##

FireFoxForensics is an application to extract various bits of activity information from the Mozilla FireFox web browser. All of the core actions e.g. import and export are run on separate threads so there are no graphical user interface (GUI) hangs etc. The user interface displays the Favourite Icons and extracted from the database, which is one area that sets it apart from the other FireFox forensic apps.
