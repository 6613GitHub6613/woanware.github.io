##Info##

Simple utility to lookup the manufacturer of a specific MAC address. It has the option to automatically update from the http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui.txt file. 

Once the lookup file has been updated, the app optimises the file and creates oui.dat, which contains just mac's and manufacturers, the file reduces from 1.24 Mb to 255Kb! so its reasonably quick.
