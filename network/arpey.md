## Info ##

A MS Windows ARP Scanner with extras. Performs ARP scans either actively or passively... 

## Process ##

- Once all of the ARP packets have been sent, a seperate thread will wait for a period of time which is defined via the Timeout value, so if you are on a slow network you can increase the time that the application will wait for responses.
- If you are working with a large network you can add a delay between each packet via the Pause value
- If you are using it with a wireless card, then go to the Config window and uncheck the "PCAP Promiscious" mode. Note that passive monitoring does not work with wireless cards due to limitations with PCAP
